# Curado en salud

Curado en salud is a blog about nutrition, fitness and health. It is the first project made entirely by myself from scratch, and its main purpose is to put in practice all the concepts and technologies that I have learnt during the past months.

I decided to not use any react framework to practice the basics and do it as modular as possible. The technologies I used are:

- Typescript
- Front-end: React
- API: Express
- ORM: Prisma
- DB: Postgres
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3
- Style: Tailwind
- Hosting: Fly.io
- Web text editor: Quill

Apart from the APP and API modules, I also decided to create a dashboard to manage and edit the post and possible future features.
